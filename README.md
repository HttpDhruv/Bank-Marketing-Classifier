Bank Marketing Classifier

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the success of a marketing campaign using a decision tree classifier. The dataset contains information about various client attributes and whether or not they subscribed to a term deposit (target variable y). The project includes steps for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.

Features:
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from two CSV files containing bank marketing data.
Data Exploration:
Displaying summary statistics and checking for missing values.
Visualizing the distribution of the target variable (y).
A correlation heatmap of encoded features.
Data Preprocessing:
Encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder.
Modeling:
Splitting the data into training and test sets.
Training a decision tree classifier to predict the target variable.
Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization:
Plotting the decision tree and displaying a correlation heatmap of features.

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Required Libraries:
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
